# Connect-two-Actors-Game
set up to share with Sasha G. and Mark W.
Idea that film actors can be related by casts in films to find a link from one actor to the other.
Three basic ways to connect:
1).  Actor.a is in the same cast as Actor.b
2).  Actor.a is not in the same cast as Actor.b; then a member of one film cast is selected from actor.a film, actor.ac
3),  If actor.ac is in a film cast of actor.b
  a) if true then found path.
  b) false then pick another actor from same or different film from either actor.a or actor.b
goto step 3.a
